//! 1. Fundamental and Derived Data Types

/*

The Fundamental Data Types in C++ are char, string, int, float, double and void that represent character, string of characters, integer, floating-point, double floating-point and valueless data.


Derived Data Types are constructed from fundamental data types. 
They can be built-in or user-defined. 
E.g :- array, functions, pointers, references, constants, classes, structures, unions and enumerations.

*/

//! 2. Scalar vs. Non-scalar data objects

/*
Data objects in C++ can be categorized as: 

? scalar (e.g. integers and pointers) 
OR
? non- scalar (e.g. arrays and classes), 

where scalars are primitive objects which contain a single value and aren't composed of other C++ objects.
*/



//!  3. Elaboration on Fundamental Data Types

/*
? A. Integer (int) - 1,4,100 - 2 or 4 bytes = 16 or 32 bits assigned contiguously



? B. Floating-point number (float) - 3.14, 1.00 - 4 bytes = 32 bits --> 8 significant digits
(each digit - 0 to 9 requires 4 bits, 0000 to 1001)
A floating constant has 2 parts --> a 'mantissa' and an 'exponent'

E.g :- 2.5E02 or 0.17E-3 <-- another type of representation of float
In the above examples, 2.5 and 0.17 are the mantissas & 02 and -3 are the exponents

Although floating-point numbers can represent numbers between integers and can represent a larger range of numbers, floating-point operations are slower than integer operations. 



? C. Double precision floating-point (double) - just like float but is 8 bytes --> 16 significant digits

It stores floating-point numbers with much larger range and precision. It is used when type float is too small or insufficiently precise.

But, the type double is larger and slower than type float.



? D. Void - takes up no space

*check voidExplanation.cpp



? E. Character (char) - c, d, @, % - 1 byte = 8 bits - represented by ascii in 8 bit form

The char type is really another integer type (as inside memory, it actually holds numbers i.e., equivalent ASCII codes of characters/symbols).

! ASCII Values are never negative so char values will always be stored internal as positive integers.

We can use:
    character = 'a';
    int var = character;
    character ++;
to get the ascii code of the character stored in var, and the increment operator can be used to get the next subsequent ascii character.
OR 
We can directly use, for example,  character == 50 to confirm relations directly, without having to assign ascii_code of character to an integer.

Single character constants are of this data type, e.g- 'a', 'Z']
Character constants must be enclosed only in single quotation marks.

NOTE that 'char' data type is not the same as 'string' data type, char is used to represent only single characters where string can represent a collection of characters.



? F. String Literals (string) - refers to a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotes
E.g :- "abc", "jk"
Each string literal is automatically added with a special character "\0" as a terminator. So, the size of the string is the number of character plus 1 for this terminator.
E.g :- size of "abc" is 4. it is stored as "abc\0" in the memory

Also, if we write '\0' (which is by default added to the end of every string), in the middle of a string, the part of the string after it is ignored.
(No particular application, just an observation.)

? G. Boolean (bool) - 0, 1 - 1 byte = 8 bits
*/

//! 4. Data Type Modifiers



/*
Except type void, the basic data types may have various modifiers preceeding them.


? a. Integer Type Modifiers

C++ offers 3 types of integers: short, int and long, each representing a different integer size. We can prefix int according to our range needs. E.g - short int a; 

Each comes in both signed and unsigned versions(in binary signed representation, the Most Significant Bit{MSB} or the left most bit, represents the sign of the integer, 0 means + and 1 means -). This gives us a choice of six different integer types.

Advantage of unsigned integers is when a quantity can't be negative(population, inventory counts etc.) we can store a bigger number in the same amount of space as we get one extra bit which was previously occupied by the sign bit.


? b. Character Type Modifiers

The char type is guaranteed to be large enough to represent the entire range of basic symbols - all the letters, digits, punctuation and the like because it occupies 1 byte(8 bits) by default and 8 bits can represent 256 unique values which are more than enough for ever character.

Since char type is just another type of integer, it can be signed or unsigned.

By default, char is signed and the numerical values it can hold range from -128 to 127. So all characters(usually all the characters present on the keyboard), occupy an ASCII value below 127. So their numerical codes aren't affected in signed or unsigned char. 

But other special characters are associated with their normal numerical codes in unsigned, since in unsigned, the range is from 0 to 255 but in case of signed, suppose a character has ASCII value of 128, it's numerical code in signed char will be -128, for a character with ASCII value of 129, it will be -127 and so on.


? c. Floating-point Type Modifiers

C++ has 3 floating-point types: float, double and long-double, (double is just long float but we call it double, there is no such thing as long float.)

float --> 4 bytes --> 32 bits --> 8 significant digits
double --> 8 bytes --> 64 bits --> 16 significant digits 
long double --> 10 bytes --> 80 bits --> 20 significant digits
(each digit - 0 to 9 requires 4 bits, 0000 to 1001)

These are signed by default and only some implementations allow for unsigned. But this is not advisable, as it reduces the portability of your code.

/*
Output will be B, the character with the subsequent ASCII number code.
 
This increment operator changes the associated ASCII number code of the character stored, and the character also changes as a result of that to the character with the new corresponding ASCII number code.

If, for example, the stored value of ch would have been 'z', and increment by 1 would've been implemented, the stored character would change to '{' which is after 'z' in ASCII code.
